# Documentation

This site provides documentation for integereleven software solutions.

integereleven uses the [Diátaxis][diataxis] approach to guide our documentation, in turn guiding the development
of our solutions. Diátaxis identified four different kinds of documentation: Tutorials, How-to guides, Reference, and Explanation.

## Projects

Documentation for integereleven open-source libraries.

### kodzutsumi

kodzutsumi, simply known as kz, is a collection of libraries for building just about anything on the [Deno][deno] runtime.

## Applications

Documentation for integereleven applications.

### Exception Explainer

The Exception Explainer, or ex<sup>2</sup>, is a reference tool for exceptions created by integereleven solutions. It aims to 
assist in resolving application issues by providing insight into exceptions and underlying causes.

> Exception explainer does no telemetry and tracks no data of any kind. It simply renders and make static inferences about the information sent to it.
